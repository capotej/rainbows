= TODO items for Rainbows!

We're lazy and pick the easy items to do first, then the ones people
care about.

* investigate non-Rack frameworks (e.g. Goliath)

* documentation improvements

* allow _OPTIONAL_ splice(2) with DevFdResponse under Linux
  (splice is very broken under some older kernels)

* Improve test suite coverage.  We won't waste cycles with puny
  unit tests, only integration tests that exercise externally
  visible parts.

* test and improve performance (throughput/latency/memory usage)
