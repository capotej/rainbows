= TODO items for Rainbows!

We're lazy and pick the easy items to do first, then the ones people
care about.

* Improve test suite coverage.  We won't waste cycles with puny
  unit tests, only integration tests that exercise externally
  visible parts.

* EventMachine.spawn - should be like Revactor, maybe?

* EventMachine deferrables

* conditional app.deferred?(env) support
  Merb uses it, some other servers support it

* EventMachine+Fibers+streaming input

* RevFiberPool

* ThreadPoolRevFiber{Spawn,Pool}: just because

* Rev + callcc - current Rev model with callcc (should work with MBARI)

* Omnibus - haven't looked into it, probably like Revactor with 1.8?

* Packet - pure Ruby, EventMachine-like library

* Rubinius Actors - should be like Revactor and easily doable once
  Rubinius gets more mature.

* test and improve performance (throughput/latency/memory usage)
