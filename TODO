= TODO items for Rainbows!

We're lazy and pick the easy items to do first, then the ones people
care about.

* Rev + Thread - current Rev model with threading, which will give
  us a streaming (but rewindable) "rack.input".

* EventMachine - much like Rev, but we haven't looked at this one much
  (our benevolent dictator doesn't like C++).  If we can figure out how
  to do Rev without Revactor, then this should be pretty easy.

* Fiber support - Revactor already uses these with Ruby 1.9, also not
  sure how TeeInput can be done with this.

* Omnibus - haven't looked into it, probably like Revactor with 1.8?

* Rubinius Actors - should be like Revactor and easily doable once
  Rubinius gets more mature.
