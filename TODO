= TODO items for Rainbows!

We're lazy and pick the easy items to do first, then the ones people
care about.

* documentation improvements

* Split out NeverBlock into NeverBlockEventMachine and NeverBlockReactor
  NeverBlock will default to one of them (depending on NB upstream).

* allow _OPTIONAL_ splice(2) with DevFdResponse under Linux
  (splice is very broken under some older kernels)

* use IO#sendfile_nonblock for EventMachine/Revactor/NeverBlock

* Open file cache Rack app/middleware (idea from nginx), since sendfile
  (and IO.copy_stream) allows pread(2)-style offsets

* Byte range responses for static files + sendfile

* Improve test suite coverage.  We won't waste cycles with puny
  unit tests, only integration tests that exercise externally
  visible parts.

* EventMachine+Fibers+streaming input
  (those who do not require streaming input can use
  {rack-fiber_pool}[http://github.com/mperham/rack-fiber_pool])

* RevFiberPool

* ThreadPoolRevFiber{Spawn,Pool}: just because

* Rev + callcc - current Rev model with callcc (should work with MBARI)

* Omnibus - haven't looked into it, probably like Revactor with 1.8?

* Packet - pure Ruby, EventMachine-like library

* Rubinius Actors - should be like Revactor and easily doable once
  Rubinius gets more mature.

* test and improve performance (throughput/latency/memory usage)
