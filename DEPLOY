= Deploying \Rainbows!

== nginx proxying to \Rainbows! or Unicorn

For high-traffic applications, routing slow actions to \Rainbows! with
nginx is recommended as nginx can serve static files faster and nginx
can forward fast actions to Unicorn.

          static files
            |
      nginx |--> slow actions --> Rainbows!
            |
            `--> fast actions --> Unicorn

Be sure to set <tt>proxy_buffering off</tt> in nginx for "slow actions"
if you have Comet applications (but not for Unicorn).

== \Rainbows! only

For the daring (or low-traffic sites), you should consider deploying
\Rainbows! in a standalone configuration.  This will be more highly
recommended as \Rainbows! stabilizes, especially if static file
performance improves (or you don't need them).

You will need to do this to support things like BOSH or do real-time
processing of the request body as it is being uploaded.

In this case, haproxy or any similar (non-request-body-buffering) load
balancer should be used to balance requests between different machines.
