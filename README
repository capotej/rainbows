= Rainbows! Unicorn for sleepy apps and slow clients

Rainbows! is a HTTP server for sleepy Rack applications.  It is based on
Unicorn, but designed to handle applications that expect long
request/response times and/or slow clients.  For Rack applications not
heavily bound by slow external network dependencies, consider Unicorn
instead as it simpler and easier to debug.

== \Rainbows! is about Diversity

We aim to support as many concurrency models as we can because they all
suck; differently.

For network concurrency, models we currently support are:

* {:ThreadSpawn}[link:Rainbows/ThreadSpawn.html]
* {:ThreadPool}[link:Rainbows/ThreadPool.html]
* {:Revactor}[link:Rainbows/Revactor.html]
* {:Rev}[link:Rainbows/Rev.html]*

We have {more on the way}[link:TODO.html] for handling network concurrency.
Additionally, we also use multiple processes (managed by Unicorn) for
CPU/memory/disk concurrency.

\* the \Rev concurrency model does not support streaming "rack.input" to
the application.  All other models support a streaming "rack.input" which
allows the Rack application to read data as it arrives on the socket
without fully buffering it first.

== Features

* Designed for {Rack}[http://rack.rubyforge.org/], the standard for
  modern Ruby HTTP applications.

* Built on {Unicorn}[http://unicorn.bogomips.org/], inheriting its
  process/socket management features
  such as transparent upgrades and Ruby configuration DSL.

* As with Unicorn, it is able to stream large request bodies off the
  socket to the application while the client is still uploading.  Since
  \Rainbows! can handle slow clients, this feature is more useful than
  it is with Unicorn.

* Combines heavyweight concurrency (worker processes) with lightweight
  concurrency (Actors or Threads), allowing CPU/memory/disk to be scaled
  independently of client connections.  Alternative concurrency models
  (listed in the TODO) will be supported as we find time for them.

== Applications

\Rainbows is for the odd things Unicorn sucks at:

* 3rd-party APIs (to services outside your control/LAN)
* OpenID consumers (to providers outside your control/LAN)
* Reverse proxy implementations with editing/censoring
  (to upstreams outside your control/LAN)
* Comet
* BOSH (with slow clients)
* HTTP server push
* Long polling
* Reverse Ajax

== Install

You may download the tarball from the Rainbows project page on Rubyforge
and run setup.rb after unpacking it:

http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=8977

You may also install it via Rubygems on Rubyforge:

  gem install rainbows

== Usage

=== for Rack applications

In APP_ROOT (where config.ru is located), run:

  rainbows

\Rainbows! will bind to all interfaces on TCP port 8080 by default.

=== Configuration File(s)

\Rainbows! will look for the config.ru file used by rackup in APP_ROOT.

For deployments, it can use a config file for Unicorn and
\Rainbows!-specific options specified by the +--config-file/-c+
command-line switch.  \Rainbows! accepts all options found in
{Unicorn::Configurator}[http://unicorn.bogomips.org/Unicorn/Configurator.html]
as well as the "\Rainbows!" block, so you can have the following in your
config file:

    Rainbows! do
      use :Revactor
      worker_connections 400
    end

See the {Rainbows! configuration documentation}[link:Rainbows.html#M000001]
for more details.

== Development

* git: git://git.bogomips.org/rainbows.git
* cgit: http://git.bogomips.org/cgit/rainbows.git

Inline patches (from "git format-patch") to the mailing list are
preferred because they allow code review and comments in the reply to
the patch.

We will adhere to mostly the same conventions for patch submissions as
git itself.  See the Documentation/SubmittingPatches document
distributed with git on on patch submission guidelines to follow.  Just
don't email the git mailing list or maintainer with \Rainbows! patches.

== Disclaimer

There is NO WARRANTY whatsoever if anything goes wrong, but let us know
and we'll try our best to fix it.

== Contact

All feedback (bug reports, user/development dicussion, patches, pull
requests) go to the mailing list/newsgroup.  Patches must be sent inline
(git format-patch -M + git send-email).  No subscription is necessary
to post on the mailing list.  No top posting.  Address replies +To:+
